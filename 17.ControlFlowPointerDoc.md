# Control Flow - Pointers

```go
  a := 5
  b := a
```

When assiging a variable to another variable,
some type get copied, whereas other are pointers to original.

`Copying` creates a new copy of original value (at time of b:=a); then original and copy are independent of each other.
Change in one donot affects change in other.

Pointer do not create new copy, but point to value of original. Change in `a` effects `b` and vice-versa.

Copies (change in original dont effect copies):

- `numbers`
- `strings`
- `structs`,
- `array`,
- `append` operation

Reference or pointer:

- `slice`
- `maps`
- `&a`

Explicitily declare a pointer;

```go
 b := &a;
//  or
var b *int = &a
```

Read value to which pointer is pointing

```go
 val := *b
```

Type of Pointer = *type like *int
