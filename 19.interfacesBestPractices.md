# Interface

### Best Practices

- Use many, small interfaces
  - Single method interfaces are powerfull and flexible
    like io.Writer, io.Reader, interface{}
- Don`t export interfaces for types that will be consumed.
- Do export interfaces for types that will be used by package.
- Design functions and methods to receive interfaces whenever possible.

Implicitly declare interfaces that a sayHello method expects data in bytes and outputs a string.

```go
type SomeInterface interface {
  sayHello(data []bytes) string
}

type SomeOtherInterface interface {
  getLength() int
}
```

Any developer can use this method according to its use case, thus having only few restrictions that is data should be in
bytes and output will be a string.

getLength outputs a int; developers are free to use any
which way on their types.


getLength method can have many implementation and can return
different type for different types. Actually, everything will
work just fine without an interface.

Interface just define what is expected if that interface is
implemented.

Best practices says always design functions and methods to receive interfaces whenever possible.
