# Go Routines

## Note for Javascript developers
Go do not have any concept of promises or async/await as in other languages,
and we should not try to think of async or concurrent programming in go in terms of
promises or async/await instead learn golang own patterns and methods.

## What is a goroutine
A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.

Any typical go function can be run in a seperate light weight thread called goroutine
just by using `go` keyword in front of function execution

Note: go also have anoymous goroutines as well.
```go
go func(){
  fmt.Println(msg)
}()
```

A goroutine as mentioned runs in a seperate thread, thus not blocking the main thread.
Remember, if main thread is done the program will exit, to avoid exiting main thread unless 
all pending goroutines are finished use waitGroup

### Best Practices

1. Don`t create goroutines in libraries
  - Let consumer control concurrency

2. When creating a goroutine, know how it will end
  - Avoids subtle memory leaks

3. Check for race conditions at compile time
  - Run your go file with -race to analyze which variables will change for go routines.
```bash
go run -race main.go
```

## Anonymous Go routine

```go
msg := "Hello"
go func(){
  fmt.Println(msg)
}()
msg = "World"
```

vs

```go
msg := "Hello"
go func(msg string){
  fmt.Println(msg)
}(msg)
msg = "World"
```
1st prints "World" - Here global state is used, and it has changed by the time fmt line is executed
2nd prints "Hello" - Arguments are eagerly used. 

Same applies to declared functions
```go
func someFunc(msg){
  fmt.Println(msg)
}()

msg := "Hello"
go someFunc(msg)
```

## Wait Groups
WaitGroup is part of inbuilt `sync` package

wg := sync.WaitGroup{} tells go that there are many go routines
- wg.Add(n): add n goroutine to the group
- wg.done(): decrement running goroutine by 1
- wg.Wait(): wait until all goroutines are finished
