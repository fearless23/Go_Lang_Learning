# Go Routines

### Best Practices

1. Don`t create goroutines in libraries

   - Let consumer control concurrency

2. When creating a goroutine, know how it will end

   - Avoids subtle memory leaks

3. Check for race conditions at compile time

   - Run your go file with -race to analyze which variables
     will change for go routines.

   ```bash
   go run -race main.go
   ```

4. Anonymous Go routine

```go
msg := "Hello"
go func(){
  fmt.Println(msg)
}()
msg = "End"
```

vs

```go
msg := "Hello"
go func(msg string){
  fmt.Println(msg)
}(msg)
msg = "End"
```
1st prints "End" - Here global state is used, and it changes.
2nd prints "Hello" - Arguments are eagerly used. 

5. Wait Groups
wg := sync.WaitGroup{} tells go that there are many go routines
wg.Add tells go to add one more go routine
wg.done tells to decrement i.e particular go routine is done.
wg.Wait tells all go routines are finished; if not exit.
