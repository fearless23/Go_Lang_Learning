## Channels

Channel in go is like a pipe through which you can send and receive values with the operator `<-`

```go
ch := make(chan int)
ch <- valueToSend   // Send some value to channel ch
valueReceived := <-ch // Receive some value from channel ch
// NOTE: valueToSend and valueReceived in of same type and that tpye is defined at time to channel creation
```

That is basically it for the definition of channel...

## Properties
- Channel have FIFO queue behaviour
- You can only perform one operation at a time, (read or write); thus no lock issues

## Note on use-cases
Using a pipe to send and receive values within main thread is not that usefull, since we can 
always pass value to function directly.
But, if we need to communicate between goroutines channel is a good way to do that. 
Also, we cam use channel to send and receive values from a channel into our main thread.

## channel communication
- between 2 goroutines
- between main thread and goroutine
















## Simple metrics on how slow/fast concurrent code is ?

### Example 1
- Given a operation takes 1ms and thread-spawn also takes 1ms

SYNC
22 operations one-by-one -> total time taken => 22ms

CONCURRENT (spawn 2 thread and divide the no. of operations)
thread 1: 11 operations one-by-one -> toal time taken = 11ms
thread 2: 11 operations one-by-one -> toal time taken = 11ms
main thread: 1 operation: 1ms
total: 11ms +  1ms + thread-spawn overhead(2ms) ==> 14ms  (faster by 8ms)

### Example 2
- Given a operation takes 0.0001ms and thread-spawn also takes 1ms

SYNC
22 operations one-by-one -> total time taken = 0.0022 ms

CONCURRENT (spawn 2 thread and divide the no. of operations)
thread 1: 11 operations one-by-one -> toal time taken =  0.0011ms
thread 2: 11 operations one-by-one -> toal time taken =  0.0011ms
main thread: 1 operation: 0.0001ms
total: 0.0011ms + 0.0001ms + thread-spawn overhead(1ms) ==> 1.0012ms (slower by 0.999ms)
